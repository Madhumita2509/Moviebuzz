				    old classmate, Aditi Mehra (Kalki Koechlin), makes her realize that she wants more from life than high
				    marks. Thus, she makes an impulsive decision to follow Aditi on a hiking trip into the Himalayas, up
				    to Manali without informing her overbearing parents. During the hike, she renews her friendship with
				    other former classmates, Kabir "Bunny" Thapar (Ranbir Kapoor) and Avinash "Avi" Arora (Aditya Roy Kapoor).

				    Bunny and Avi start. During the train ride, Bunny meets Lara (Evelyn Sharma). She is stylish
				    and sought after by boys. Bunny starts flirting with her, and she falls for Bunny. Seeing this

					In the course of the mountain trek, Bunny and Naina become close. Bunny teaches Naina to laugh, to play,
				    and more importantly, to love. At the end of the trip, she is close to telling him that she is in love 
				    with him, but is interrupted by Avi who has accidentally found a letter accepting Bunny into a graduate 
				    school in journalism, at Northwestern University in Chicago. Bunny explains that the trip is his last 
				    hometown adventure before he leaves. He is sad to leave his friends but excited to start a career that
				    will lead to travelling, which he dreams of, and which is why he wanted to bring his two best friends 
				    along to Manali to give them a surprise. Naina realises that love and marriage have no part in Bunny's 
				    plans and remains silent about her feelings, but is happy for him as he is following his passion.

				<p class="divo">Eight years have passed, Naina has finished medical school and is now working in a clinic. In the meantime, 
					Bunny works as a videographer for a travel show on FOX network and travels the world as he had always planned. 
					He receives an offer to become a host for a new travel show and then receives an email from Aditi - who is 
					getting married with Taran Khanna and wants her best friend Bunny to help her celebrate. During the course of 
					the eight years, Aditi and Naina have become best friends. While at the wedding Bunny re-acquaints himself with 
					Avi, Aditi & Naina. While the girls are happy to see him, Avi isn't and ends up fighting with Bunny. It is 
					revealed in the argument that Bunny's father has died and as Kabir was in a remote area, he was not able to 
					attend his last rites. Naina has moved ahead in life and is not waiting to meet Bunny but they meet at Udaipur,

					Bunny because he is not able to figure out that he is in love with Naina and Naina, as she doesn't want to get her 
					heart broken again. A day before the wedding, Bunny sees Naina with another man, Vikram, who is the wedding photographer. 
					He is Naina's friend, but Bunny assumes him to be her boyfriend, feels jealous and argues with him, finally sending him away. 
					Bunny and Naina meet, argue, and reveal their feelings by kissing each other. Yet neither of them is willing to give up a 
					career to follow the other. It seems that their romance is over.  </p><p class="vid"> Bunny leaves for Paris on 
					the night of Aditi's wedding. While sitting at the airport he realises what he is leaving behind and instead goes to his home where 
					he reconciles with his step mother. On New Year's Eve, as Naina sits alone at home along with her dog, someone knocks on her door and 
					it's Bunny. He surprises her with a kiss. He has turned down his dream job to be with Naina and proposes to her, but Naina fears that 
					he might regret his decision in the future. However, Bunny says that he is happy with Naina and wants to continue travelling but with 
					her. He argues that somehow they can make a life together and Naina agrees. 		</div>
